# Python Challenge - Financial and Voting Analysis

This repository contains Python scripts that analyze financial and voting datasets to generate insightful reports.

# Datasets:
1. Financial Data (budget_data.csv): Contains the financial records of a company, with two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
2. Election Data (election_data.csv): Consists of vote records, with three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate".


PyBank (main.py inside PyBank folder): Analyzes the financial records to provide:

- Total number of months in the dataset.
- Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- Average change in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.



PyPoll (main.py inside PyPoll folder): Analyzes the voting records to determine:

- Total number of votes cast.
- List of candidates who received votes.
- Percentage of votes each candidate won.
- Total number of votes each candidate won.
- Winner of the election based on popular vote.
